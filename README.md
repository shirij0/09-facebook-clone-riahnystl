For this assignment, you will be creating a "clone" of a facebook profile page. Your objective is to re-create the layout, features, and style of the Facebook profile page as closely as possible. It is acceptable to change some details- like the colors and fonts, but the overall look and feel should be as close to Facebook as possible. You can be creative in who you choose as the subject of your profile page- a historical figure, a celebrity, a pet, etc. This page will be purely static- no need to create clickable drop-downs, pop-ups, etc.


﻿﻿Please complete these specific requirements:


* A static (fixed to the top of the window) site header with a logo, search bar, and navigation.
* Cover photo, profile photo, and some navigation buttons.
* Sidebar on the left with "about me" information, photo thumbnails, and friends thumbnails.
* Main content column with a form to add a new post.
* At least three posts on the page. At least one post needs to include a photo. All posts need the following:
  * Post content (text, video, photo)
  * Like button with some likes
  * Add comment form
  * A friendly comment or two
* A static sidebar on the right with two ads. (can be ads for anything you like, real or imaginary)
